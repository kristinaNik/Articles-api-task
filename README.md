# Articles API

## Overview

The Articles API is a service designed to fetch, store, and manage articles from various sources. The API allows users to retrieve articles, search for articles by keywords, and store new articles in the database.

The project includes both a Laravel back end and a React front end to manage and display articles.

## Environment

### Configuration
To access third-party APIs such as The Guardian, New York Times, or News API, you need to set the appropriate environment variable. The application will automatically bind the correct service provider based on your configuration.

The service provider binding is determined by the ARTICLE_SERVICE environment variable. Depending on the value you set, the corresponding API service will be used to fetch articles.

Hereâ€™s how the binding is handled in the application:

```php
   $service = config('services.article_service');

   if ($service === 'guardian') {
       $this->app->bind(ArticleServiceInterface::class, GuardianArticleService::class);
   } elseif ($service === 'new_york_times') {
       $this->app->bind(ArticleServiceInterface::class, NewYorkTimesArticleService::class);
   } elseif ($service === 'news') {
       $this->app->bind(ArticleServiceInterface::class, NewsApiArticleService::class);
   } else {
       throw new \Exception("Unsupported article service: $service");
   }
```
### Setting the Service Provider

In your .env file, define the ARTICLE_SERVICE variable to specify which third-party API service youâ€™d like to use. For example:
```bash 
# Use the New York Times API
ARTICLE_SERVICE=new_york_times

# Or, use The Guardian API
# ARTICLE_SERVICE=guardian

# Or, use the News API
# ARTICLE_SERVICE=news
```
## Command and Scheduler

To automate the process of fetching and storing articles from external sources, the application uses a custom Artisan command. This command can be scheduled to run automatically at specified intervals using Laravelâ€™s task scheduler.

### Running the Command Manually

```bash
php artisan articles:fetch-and-store
```

This will trigger the process of fetching articles and saving them to the database.

### Scheduling and the command

The articles:fetch-and-store command can be scheduled to run automatically at specific intervals. In this case, the command is set to run daily using Laravelâ€™s task scheduling feature, defined in console.php:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

// Schedule the article fetching command to run daily
Schedule::command('articles:fetch-and-store')->daily();
```
